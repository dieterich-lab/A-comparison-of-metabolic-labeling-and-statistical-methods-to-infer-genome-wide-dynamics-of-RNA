## Supplementary material referenced in the published manuscript.

- Supplementary File 1: Mapping quality control
- Supplementary File 2: pulseR quality control (see *pulseRTc/workflow/mismatches/* )
- Supplementary File 3: GRAND-SLAM quality control (see *grand-slam/* )
- Supplementary File 4: pulseR results using a different variant caller
- Supplementary File 5: Estimating variance and optimal labeling time using the pulseR workflow


In addition, under *supplement/dge*, we include a global gene expression analysis between no labeling
and the different labeling durations for the nucleotide conversion protocols. 

Under *supplement/deu*, we include a differential exon usage analysis using the nucleotide conversion protocols.

**Note**: Additional R packages are required to run the DGE and the DEU analyses.
